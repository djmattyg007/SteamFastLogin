Steam Fast Login

This is a small project designed to provide a fast account switcher for Steam.
There are similiar projects already in the wild, but none of the ones I found
supported Linux. Support for other platforms is welcome.

This software is currently ALPHA. It is not fully functional yet, nor has it
had extensive testing.
