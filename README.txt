Steam Fast Login

This is a small project designed to provide a fast account switcher for Steam.
There are similiar projects already in the wild, but none of the ones I found
supported Linux. Support for other platforms is welcome.

The application relies on you having a service to store secrets securely. On
Linux, this is typically known as the Keyring. The application will not
function correctly without an active Keyring.

The application is built on top of Qt5 and PyQt5. You can find screenshots in
the PNG files in this repo.
